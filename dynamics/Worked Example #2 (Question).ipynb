    "Consider the lightweight steel frame structure shown below. It supports heavy machinery with a total mass of $m = 10,000\\: kg$. We can neglect the weight of the steel frame. Based on an experimental impact test, the inherent structural damping has been estimated to be 2% ($\\xi=0.02$).\n",

    "A load test has shown that a lateral force of $P=1500\\: N$ induces a lateral displacement of $\\Delta = 7 \\:mm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steel frame is constrained such that it can only move laterally (i.e. there is no twisting or significant vertical movement). As such it can be modelled as a SDoF system as shown on the right. \n",
