    "We can determine an analytical solution to this equation of motion using superposition (remember linear analysis assumed over the duration of a timestep). The complete solution consists of three components:\n",

    "The solution to the differential equation describing each of the three components of response can be obtained by using the same procedures demonstrated previously in this course (solving to find homogeneous and complimentary solutions to the various equations of motion). For brevity we will simply state the solutions here rather than deriving each. \n",

    "### Computational Scheme\n",
    "In order to implement this concept in a simple time-stepping algorithm, we'll first restructure the equations to make them more 'algorithm friendly'. I've used the formulation presented by [Humar]. You can optionally refer to that text for more on this but everything you need to implement this technique is presented here. \n",
